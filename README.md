## Overview
Racial disparities in breast cancer outcomes remain a major public health concern, particularly for African American women, who exhibit significantly higher mortality rates compared to their European American counterparts. A key contributing factor is the underrepresentation of racially diverse populations in cancer genomics datasets, which hinders the generalizability of machine learning (ML) models. To address this issue, we propose a weighted multimodal framework that incorporates transfer learning and interpolation-based data augmentation. Utilizing mRNA, miRNA, and DNA methylation data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the model is pretrained on European American samples and fine-tuned on African American data. SMOTE is applied to enhance minority class representation, and omics-aware weighting is employed to optimize multi-omics integration. Experimental results show that this combined strategy substantially improves predictive performance for the African American cohort, offering a promising approach for mitigating performance gaps in cancer prognosis modeling.

## Instructions

```
usage: BRCA_weightedTLDA.py [-h] --in_path IN_PATH --out_path OUT_PATH --cpoint CPOINT --year YEAR

This script implements a fairness-aware deep learning model designed to mitigate
racial disparities in breast cancer prognosis. It integrates transfer learning and
synthetic data augmentation (SMOTE) with weighted multi-omics representation to
improve predictive performance in underrepresented populations. The model is
pretrained on European American data and fine-tuned on African American data using
contrastive domain adaptation.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --in_path IN_PATH     Path to the input multi-omics data and other materials
                        for model training.
  --out_path OUT_PATH   Path for all output files after model training.
  --cpoint CPOINT       Clinical endpoint of interest for prognosis prediction
                        (e.g., PFI, DSS).
  --year YEAR           Time threshold used to define positive prognosis events.

Examples:
  python BRCA_weightedTLDA.py \
      --in_path /home/user/project/input \
      --out_path /home/user/project/output \
      --cpoint PFI \
      --year 3
